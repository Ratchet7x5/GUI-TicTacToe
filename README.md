![gui](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b8518d-d6d3-4a73-a93d-0c47619aa5d0)

## Overview

This project is a simple GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using [insert framework or language, e.g., Python and Tkinter]. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. The project demonstrates my skills in GUI development and basic game logic implementation.

## Features

- **Player vs Player**: Two players can take turns playing on the same machine.
- **Simple GUI**: A user-friendly interface that visually represents the game board and player actions.
- **Winner Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game at any time without relaunching the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: [Python, Java, C#, etc.]
- **GUI Framework**: [Tkinter, JavaFX, WPF, etc.]
- **Development Environment**: [Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.]
